My brother Vishal and I love our mother’s food. She cooks good food for us every day. She teaches me how to cook. When my friends come to my house, she cooks food for them as well. When my friend Rahul comes to my house, she gives him chocolate. He likes it. My mother is always happy to see him. My mother does so much for us. I love her. Who does the cooking?","description":"","object_id":"a9ea765f-7464-43d3-a434-00c473211b4d","status":"PUBLISHED","lft":4012,"rght":4013,"tree_id":1,"level":3,"parent":"b97fe3fe-06ca-4a79-950b-24c8995ab195","content_type":22,"account":"0429fb91-4f3c-47de-9adb-609996962188"},"objects":[]}]}],"scores":{},"key":189},"_id":"0e2ad10a-d44a-4edb-8975-1c09a5962559","_rev":"1-14df878ec228b312f08434daa600e88f"},{"lesson":{"node":{"id":"14364df8-bf30-495a-a24b-cdfe058f6c08","content_type_name":"lesson","type":{"id":"50972ff6-fd1d-4a4a-b901-9ec260560c90","grade":3,"difficulty":1,"microstandard":"ELL.1.MAL.V.21","skill":"Reading","deleted":null,"objective":"Students read a passage which contains a lot of “have to’s” and “like to’s” and reply to basic reading comprehension questions about that text."},"tag":"Reading","meta":{"intros":{}},"deleted":null,"created":"2016-08-06T13:43:14.492931Z","updated":"2016-08-06T13:43:14.495243Z","title":"Reading - Comprehension - have to vs like to","description":"Students read a passage which contains a lot of “have to’s” and “like to’s” and reply to basic reading comprehension questions about that text.","object_id":"50972ff6-fd1d-4a4a-b901-9ec260560c90","status":"PUBLISHED","lft":3638,"rght":3649,"tree_id":1,"level":1,"parent":"ce436934-2164-4790-8254-6b71dac16296","content_type":25,"account":"0429fb91-4f3c-47de-9adb-609996962188"},"objects":[{"node":{"id":"09ebabfb-d554-4ec7-94bb-b541a182ad1d","content_type_name":"assessment","type":{"id":"59e2d2c8-0817-453b-af50-80e38242679a","deleted":null,"type":"practice","score":40},"tag":null,"meta":{},"deleted":null,"created":"2016-08-06T13:43:14.518166Z","updated":"2016-08-06T13:43:14.518187Z","title":"Reading - Comprehension - have to vs like to","description":"Reading - Comprehension - have to vs like to","object_id":"59e2d2c8-0817-453b-af50-80e38242679a","status":"PUBLISHED","lft":3639,"rght":3648,"tree_id":1,"level":2,"parent":"14364df8-bf30-495a-a24b-cdfe058f6c08","content_type":26,"account":"0429fb91-4f3c-47de-9adb-609996962188"},"objects":[{"node":{"id":"ee277910-c3ea-4ed9-b5df-d2361ef30bec","content_type_name":"json question","type":{"id":"b7a6e258-2b16-4bbf-8168-f37ac1edb879","deleted":"None","created":"2016-08-06T13:43:14.540396Z","updated":"2016-08-06T13:43:14.540420Z","is_critical_thinking":false,"level":1,"answer":[4],"score":10,"content":{"widgets":{"videos":{},"sounds":{},"images":{}},"hints":"[]","options":[{"key":2,"option":"do the dishes"},{"key":1,"option":"do the shopping"},{"key":3,"option":"do his homework"},{"key":4,"option":"read books"}],"is_multiple":false},"type":"choicequestion","microstandard":"f89c4383-204e-44c0-b759-ef6b0742199e"},"tag":null,"meta":{"instructions":{"sounds":["/media/ell/instructions/019.mp3"]}},"deleted":null,"created":"2016-08-06T13:43:14.548003Z","updated":"2016-08-06T13:43:14.548022Z","title":"I like to, I have to My name is Rahul There are many things  I have to do.
